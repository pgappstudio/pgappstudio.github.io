<h3>Scales & Diatonic Chords</h3>
<p>
The Scales & Chords tool is used for studying how Diatonic-Chords (Triad and 7th) are formed for different scales on any selected Key/Root.
</p>

<p>
How to use the tool:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Select Root/Key from the top-left dropdown.
<li>Select Scale from the top-right dropdown.
<li>Play the Scale notes can by tapping the Scale Notes area.
<li>Play the Chords by tapping the triad or 7th chords.
<li>I, IV and V triads and 7th chords (marked with box) are minimal chords that can be used to harmonize any scale notes.
<li>Chords marked with same colour can be used as alternate/replacement to any chord, to overcome monotonous chord progression.
<li>Enable the REPEAT button for playing the selected chord repetitively along with Metronome beat when Metronome is running.
<li>Selected Chord notes are displayed on the Piano/Guitar-fretboard/Staff.
</ul>
