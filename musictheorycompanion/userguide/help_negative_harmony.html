<h3>Negative Harmony</h3>
<p>
The Negative Harmony tool which is based on the Riemannian theory, can be used to find out the negative harmony notes for the chromatic scales and for finding out the negative harmony notes, triads and 7th chords for any selected scale.
</p>

<p>
How to use the tool:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Select Root/key from the top-left dropdown</li>
<li>Select Scale from the top-right dropdown</li>
<li>Play the chromatic notes by tapping on them</li>
<li>Play the scale notes, triads, seventh chords and corresponding negative harmony counter parts by tapping on them</li>
<li>Whenever any note or chord is selected, its corresponding Negative Harmony counter part is also highlighted</li>
<li>Enable the REPEAT button for playing the selected chord repetitively along with Metronome beat when Metronome is running.
<li>Selected Chord-notes/Note are displayed on the Piano/Guitar-fretboard/Staff.
</ul>
