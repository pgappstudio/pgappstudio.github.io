<h3>Circle of Fifths</h3>

<p>In music theory, the circle of fifths is a way of organizing the 12 chromatic pitches as a sequence of perfect fifths. If C is chosen as a starting point, the sequence is: C, G, D, A, E, B (=C♭), F♯ (=G♭), C♯ (=D♭), A♭, E♭, B♭, F. Continuing the pattern from F returns the sequence to its starting point of C. This order places the most closely related key signatures adjacent to one another. It is usually illustrated in the form of a circle.</p>

<p>The Circle of Fifths tool is used to find out Circle of Fifths and Circle of Fourths for different scales on any selected Key/Root.</p>

<p>Find more detail about the concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths">here</a></p>

<p><b>How to use the tool:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Select Root/Key from the top-left dropdown or by rotating the notes wheel.
<li>Select Scale from the top-right dropdown.
<li>Play the Chords by tapping on any chord highlighted with colour on the notes wheel.
