<h3>Metronome</h3>
<p>
The metronome tool is used in music to maintain a consistent tempo (speed) by producing regular clicks or beats at a specified beats per minute (BPM). Musicians use metronomes for practicing, rehearsing in groups, and ensuring precise timing during performances.
</p>

<p>How to use the tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable/disable playing first beat accent as needed.
<li>Select the percussion instruments for beat/accent-beat/sub-beat sounds from the respective drop-downs.

<li>Set time signature from the drop-downs.
<li>Set beat subdivision from the drop-down.

<li>Set tempo BPM with tap, pressing +/- buttons or sliding the slider.
<li>Enable the Speed Trainer switch for increasing/decreasing the tempo at a configured interval.
<li>Tap the Start/Stop button to start/stop the metronome.
<li>Beat number and measure number are displayed when metronome is running.
</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> The Speed Trainer function works only when the metronome tool screen is active.</p>
