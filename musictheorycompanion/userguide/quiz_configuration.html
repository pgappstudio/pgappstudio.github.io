<h3>Quiz Configuration</h3>

<p>
The Quiz Configuration page lets you configure the type of quiz you want to practice.
</p>

<p>
Music theory concepts are divided into following categories:
<ul>
<li>Note identification</li>
<li>Note reading</li>
<li>Interval identification</li>
<li>Interval comparison</li>
<li>Interval reading</li>
<li>Scale identification</li>
<li>Scale reading</li>
<li>Chord identification</li>
<li>Chord reading</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
On each category there are 6 levels (Level 1 - Level 6), level 1 being the easiest and level 6 the hardest.
</p>

<p>
Initially by randomly asking you questions from all the levels of all categories, the app learns about your
current levels for each category.
</p>

<p>
And then the app asks you questions from all the categories based on your current level in any category.
</p>

<p>
As you continue improving your skills by practicing more, and your consistency of correct answer reaches
a threshold level for any category, you will move to the next level in that category.
</p>

<p>
And the app will continue asking you questions from the next level.
